The goal of this assignment is to create a simple e-commerce website using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.

How to run the project:  

 For a user to shop on the webpage, they must either create an account or log in. After logging in, the user can click on the Products tab to view the items available for purchase. When the user clicks the Add to Cart button, an alert will appear confirming that the item has been added to the cart.

The user can then click on the Cart tab to view all the items they have added. From there, they can click Checkout to see the total tax and discount applied to all the items combined. After reviewing the information, the user can click Confirm, which triggers an alert stating that an invoice has been generated and sent to their email.

The user can then visit the Invoice tab to view the invoices that have been generated. Additionally, they can access the User Frequency tab to see the different genders of users who have logged in to the website. The system also allows users to search for their invoices by entering their TRN, which displays the invoice information for that user.
